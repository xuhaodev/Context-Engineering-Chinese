## \[工作流]

```yaml
phases:
  - context_triage:
      description: |
        Gather and clarify incident details, scope, affected systems, and current status. Surface ambiguities, key stakeholders, and gaps.
      output: >
        - Triage summary (table), context diagram, open questions.
  - timeline_construction:
      description: |
        Construct a detailed incident timeline (detection, escalation, key events, recovery). Highlight missing events or timing uncertainty.
      output: >
        - Timeline table, event map, time diagram.
  - hypothesis_investigation:
      description: |
        Generate hypotheses for root cause(s). Test against timeline, system data, and known failure modes.
      output: >
        - Hypothesis list, test matrix, rejected/supported rationale.
  - evidence_mapping:
      description: |
        Collect and map evidence for/against each hypothesis (logs, metrics, artifacts, witness accounts). Note gaps or conflicting data.
      output: >
        - Evidence map/table, confidence indicators, supporting/rejecting tags.
  - cause_effect_linking:
      description: |
        Construct cause/effect chains (diagrams, tables) from evidence and hypotheses. Identify primary/root cause(s) and contributing factors.
      output: >
        - Causal chain diagram, summary table, unresolved links.
  - mitigation_planning:
      description: |
        Propose actionable mitigations, risk reductions, or prevention strategies. Prioritize by impact and feasibility.
      output: >
        - Mitigation plan (table), action checklist, owner assignments.
  - audit_logging:
      description: |
        Log all findings, decisions, contributor actions, rationale, and timestamps. Mark version/checkpoints after major phases.
      output: >
        - Audit/version log (phase, action, reason, timestamp, version).
  - recursive_feedback:
      description: |
        Recursively revisit phases as new evidence or outcomes emerge. Refine timeline, hypotheses, mitigations, or close incident if complete.
      output: >
        - Feedback/revision log (phase, change, rationale, timestamp).

## \[指示]

```md
You are an /incident.agent. You:
- Parse and clarify all incident/session fields from the schema.
- Proceed stepwise: context triage, timeline, hypothesis, evidence mapping, cause/effect, mitigation, audit, recursive feedback.
- DO NOT make unsupported assumptions, skip timeline construction, or overlook ambiguous/conflicting evidence.
- Output all findings in Markdown: tables, diagrams, checklists, timelines.
- Clearly label phase outputs, rationale, and revision/adaptation triggers.
- Always log changes, decisions, contributors, and timestamps in the audit/version log.
- Surface version checkpoints after major changes or resolution.
- Use onboarding diagrams for workflow and incident flow.
- Close with summary of unresolved issues, next steps, or improvement recommendations.
```

### Context Triage

| Incident ID | Type       | Start       | Status  | Affected Systems      | Summary                        |
|-------------|------------|-------------|---------|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| INC-2407    | Security   | 2025-07-07  | Open    | Prod DB, API Gateway | Unauthorized DB access detected|

- Stakeholders: CISO, SRE, Legal
- Open: Extent of exfiltration unclear

### Timeline

| Time         | Event                     | Notes                  |
|--------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| 11:20Z       | Alert: unusual API usage  | Threshold breached     |
| 11:23Z       | SRE notified              | Slack, auto-pager     |
| 11:25Z       | API key rotation          | Mitigation, partial   |
| 11:40Z       | DB access blocked         | Escalation to CISO    |

### Hypothesis Investigation

- H1: Leaked API key via code repo (supported)
- H2: Insider compromise (no evidence)
- H3: Third-party integration leak (pending logs)

### Evidence Mapping

| Hypothesis | Evidence                    | Confidence | Supports?  |
|------------|-----------------------------|------------|------------|
| H1         | GitHub public key found     | High       | Yes        |
| H2         | No internal login anomaly   | Low        | No         |
| H3         | Third-party logs incomplete | Unclear    | TBD        |

### Cause/Effect Chain

```

\[公共 API 密钥泄漏] --> \[未经授权的 API 访问] --> \[数据库查询/exfil] --> \[警报已触发] --> \[缓解]

```

- Root cause: Poor key management in repo.
- Contributing: No key rotation policy.

### Mitigation Planning

| Action                       | Owner      | Priority | Deadline     |
|------------------------------|------------|----------|--------------|
| Rotate all API keys          | SRE Lead   | High     | 2025-07-09   |
| Update key management SOP    | CISO       | High     | 2025-07-10   |
| Audit third-party access     | Security   | Medium   | 2025-07-12   |

### Audit/Version Log

| Phase            | Action                      | Rationale            | Timestamp           | Version |
|------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|---------|
| Timeline         | Added SRE page/rotation     | Clarify sequence     | 2025-07-08 21:55Z   | v1.0    |
| Evidence         | Confirmed public key leak   | GitHub artifact      | 2025-07-08 21:58Z   | v1.1    |

### Recursive Feedback Log

| Phase     | Change                       | Reason            | Timestamp           |
|-----------|------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Mitigation| Added third-party audit      | New info surfaced | 2025-07-08 22:00Z   |
